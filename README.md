# ML-Classification-Final_Project
## Added testing and exception handling which was not a part of the project
This is a final project as part of computional learning in Python. 
I was asked to give a prediction for a future data, while all I have is a csv file. The main goal was to optimize the classification of the CSV tuples. To reach this, I used superivsed learning.
## Python packages
- skicit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
